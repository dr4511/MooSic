	<h1>How music can improve your mental health and mood</h1>

<div id="text">
  <h2> Information - </h2>

	<p>
    Mental health is an incredibly important topic of discussion. Our emotional, psychological, and social well-being all depend on it. It determines how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Everyone will go through mental health problems at some point, and it's important that we don’t ignore those issues. Although there are multiple methods to help treat and cope with our mental health problems, we would like to shine a light on how music can improve our mental health. However, some methods to treating mental health issues can be very expensive, and can also fail to properly connect with individuals on a deeper level, leaving them feeling misunderstood and isolated. Not only is music accessible, but it’s also been proven to evoke certain emotions and feelings. Research shows that various mental health conditions such as depression, trauma, schizophrenia, etc. can all benefit from music therapy. Music can act as a medium for processing emotions, trauma, and grief, but it can also be used as a calming agent for anxiety. Some of the most powerful aspects that come with music therapy are lyric analysis and active music listening.  </p>

    <p> Talking about your mental health struggles can be quite difficult, especially if you don’t understand why you are feeling what you're feeling. However lyric analysis in music therapy can help individuals connect and identify with song lyrics that may correlate with their experiences. In addition, song lyrics provide individuals with a story, and a less-threatening approach to process emotions and thoughts, allowing individuals to feel heard and understood, as their struggles and experiences are valid and they can be dealt with. In addition, active music listening involves making the individual concentrate on what they hear within music, as they take note of the feelings, memories, and bodily sensations that come up while they listen. In moments where we can feel so out of control due to our mental health struggles, music can empower us and allow us to take back some of that control.
